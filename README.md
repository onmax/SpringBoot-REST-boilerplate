# SpringBoot-REST-boilerplate
Small implementation of a REST API with Swagger UI

You can use it as a boilerplate for your new GREAT project. Also, `jdbc` is included, but you can use any database.

Also, a PDF has been uploaded where you can see how to generate a project using codegen-generator OpenAPI and Swagger UI in SpringBoot. I hope you know Spanish :p
